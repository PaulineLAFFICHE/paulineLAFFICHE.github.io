<p>I did my 6 month internship at Media Participation.
    Media-Participations Paris is a French-Belgian publishing, press and audiovisual production group founded in 1986 by the business lawyer and former minister Rémy Montagne. 
    I was Marketing Assistant for Rustica and Système D magazines, which are gardening and DIY magazines.
    My main mission during my internship was to manage the subscription website of these two magazines. I had to test the site, each part of the site had to be tested by me. I had to check that it corresponds well to the specifications. This was a long job and taught me patience and attention.
