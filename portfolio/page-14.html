<h1>Others Projects</h1>

<p><b>I did my internship in the field of Marketing 6 months ago. Here is my main achievement and its explanation.
</b></p>





<p>The Mahov offers temporary accommodation, behavioral and administrative support.
    I worked for this association to improve their communication and strategy. The whole website was redone by my team. I want to present you a realization in this project which was a flyer to promote and explain the goal of the association to those who would be interested. Working for this association has been very rewarding for me.
